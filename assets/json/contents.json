  "introduction": [" A Geotechnical Engineering virtual lab is a digital platform that allows students to conduct experiments related to Geotechnical Engineering concepts in a visual and comprehensive manner. It is a self-paced learning tool that helps students to understand fundamental concepts and prepare for physical experiments in a safe and controlled environment."],

  "objective": ["The Geotechnical Engineering virtual lab aims to provide students with a comprehensive and visual platform to conduct experiments and gain a better understanding of fundamental concepts. It is not intended to replace physical lab experiments but to supplement them. The virtual lab offers a controlled environment that minimizes risks and optimizes resources. Overall, it is an effective pedagogical tool that equips students with the necessary skills to conduct physical experiments confidently and proficiently."],
